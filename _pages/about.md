Hi, I'm a PhD candidate in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Virginia Tech. I'm currently a part of [Paul Research Group](https://paul.me.vt.edu). I'm also a graduate teaching assistant for the undergraduate Fluid Dynamics Lab.

Research
======
My research interests includes chaos, nonlinear dynamics, pattern formation, fluid dynamics and complex systems. 

I'm currently interested in building a physical understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of large chaotic systems. Examples of such systems include atmospheric and ocean dynamics, solar convection, pattern formation in colonies of bacteria, reaction-diffusion systems. Chaotic spatially extended systems can be seen as a collection of chaos-generating elements connected via spatial couplings. One of the key objectives my research is to investigate the role of spatial couplings in spatiotemporal chaos. To that end, I’m exploring simple models such as coupled map lattices (CMLs) and the more realistic models, namely, partial differential equations (PDEs). I’m looking at how certain tools from dynamical systems theory such as covariant Lyapunov vectors (CLVs) can help understand the chaotic behavior of these high dimensional systems. I'm studying pattern formation in Rayleigh–Bénard convection using the Generalized Swift-Hohenberg equation and investigating how mean flow strength can affect the tangent-space dynamics.
