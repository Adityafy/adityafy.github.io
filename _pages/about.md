Hi I'm a PhD student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Virginia Tech. Currently working in the Paul Research Group as a Graduate Research Assistant.

Research
======
My research interests includes chaos, nonlinear dynamics, pattern formation and fluid dynamics. Currently studying spatiotemporal chaos and exploring how spatially extended systems are affected by short- and long-range couplings. To that end, I’m exploring coupled map lattices (CMLs) and partial differential equations (PDEs). I’m looking at how certain tools from dynamical systems theory such as covariant Lyapunov vectors (CLVs) can help understand the chaotic behavior of these high dimensional systems. Studying pattern formation in Rayleigh–Bénard convection using the Generalized Swift-Hohenberg equation and studying how mean flow strength can affect the tangent-space dynamics. This is a fully computational study that generally involves numerical computations of tangent space equations of CMLs or PDEs. Using CLVs to study the hyperbolicity of the tangent space dynamics and potentially gain some insight about the effective dimension of the system.
