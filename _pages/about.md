Hi, I'm a PhD candidate in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Virginia Tech. I'm currently a part of [Paul Research Group](https://paul.me.vt.edu). I'm also a graduate teaching assistant for the undergraduate Fluid Dynamics Lab.

Research
======
My research interests includes chaos, nonlinear dynamics, pattern formation, fluid dynamics and complex systems. 

My research explores complex, high-dimensional systems that exhibit collective dynamics and emergent behavior ubiquitous in nature. Using computational and theoretical approaches, I investigate how interactions, coupling structures, and network organization influence system behavior. By combining tools from dynamical systems theory, such as Lyapunov analysis and covariant Lyapunov vectors, with models of spatially extended and networked systems, I aim to uncover general principles governing the underlying topology, predictability, and pattern formation in complex systems.

In this video, the color contours on the left represent the scalar field ψ in the Generalized Swift-Hohenberg equation and the arrows represent the mean flow. The color contours on the right represent the magnitude of the leading Lyapunov vector (red being the highest).
